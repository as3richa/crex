- bytecode compiler inliner and branch optimizer
- collapse chains of jmps in both native and bytecode compilers
- special case patterns:
  * empty
  * single string, all combinations of anchors
  * alternation of several strings unanchored => aho-corasick
  * branchless patterns (don't need thread scheduler!)
- run native compiler async?
- backtracking engine?? can vectorize some things wrt the string
- integrate asan's poisoning
